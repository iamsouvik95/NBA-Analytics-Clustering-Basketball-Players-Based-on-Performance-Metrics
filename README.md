# NBA-Analytics-Clustering-Basketball-Players-Based-on-Performance-Metrics using R
This project explores NBA player performance analytics through hierarchical clustering, leveraging Tidyverse functions and data visualization to uncover patterns among players based on key metrics. Using the nba_players_2023.csv dataset, which includes season statistics for 50 players, we aim to identify distinct player groupings and key attributes influencing cluster formation.

Key objectives include:

(i).Calculating combined per-game stats for points, rebounds, and assists.
(ii).Determining the optimal number of clusters (num_clusters).
(iii).Identifying the most influential performance metrics (strongest_influence) that best separate clusters.
